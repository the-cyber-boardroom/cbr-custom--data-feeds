### Project Overview

This project aims to build a FastAPI-based service that aggregates and analyzes cybersecurity news feeds. By fetching 
data from various online sources, the service normalizes this information into Python-friendly JSON schemas and stores 
it in AWS S3. Users can access this structured data through the FastAPI interface, which offers a range of services 
from free, pre-processed files to real-time data access. An LLM layer further enhances the service by providing 
analysis and personalized insights, tailored to different audiences.

Beyond cybersecurity news, the platform can be adapted to analyze other data-heavy events, such as tech conferences. By 
collecting and processing content from these events, the service can offer summaries, key insights, and trend analysis. 
This creates a versatile platform capable of transforming diverse data sources into actionable, structured insights, 
catering to the needs of a wide range of professionals.

### Project scalability

To ensure scalability, the project will utilize AWS Lambda functions that execute on a regular schedule, 
such as hourly or every few hours. These Lambdas will fetch content from the targeted websites and store 
updated versions or diffs locally. This content is then processed into Pythonic objects, which are stored in S3.

For most users, particularly those on a free tier, the service will primarily serve pre-created files from S3. 
These files represent the normalized content from the various websites, organized into a folder structure that 
facilitates user queries. The folder structure can be organized by day, week, month, or other relevant timeframes, 
allowing users to access the specific data they need.

This approach operates on a "write once, read many" principle. When updates occur, only the relevant files—such 
as those for the current day, week, or month—need to be updated. This minimizes the load on the system and ensures 
that users have fast, reliable access to the most recent data available.

This strategy allows the service to efficiently handle large volumes of data and user requests by centralizing the
data fetching and processing tasks. With the "write once, read many" approach, updates are performed only when necessary,
such as when new data is fetched. This reduces the need for constant updates and allows the service to serve pre-processed,
ready-to-use data from S3, ensuring fast and reliable access for users.

By organizing the stored data in a clear folder structure, users can easily query and retrieve the specific information 
they need, whether it's data from a particular day, week, or month. This structure also facilitates the implementation 
of different service tiers, such as a free version that serves from pre-created S3 files and a paid version offering more 
real-time data access.

Overall, this approach balances efficiency with user experience, ensuring that the service can scale to meet demand while 
providing timely, structured cybersecurity news feeds to its users.

## LLM Layer

On top of the news feed service, an LLM (Large Language Model) layer will be implemented. This layer can be offered in 
multiple tiers, ranging from a free version using open-source or community models (like Grok or SambaNova) to a paid 
version with premium models. Users can access this LLM layer through a credit-based system or other subscription models.

The LLM layer will serve two key functions:

1. Analysis: This function provides insights based on the fetched data, assessing the current threat landscape and 
categorizing the day's cybersecurity climate (e.g., red, green, or alert levels). It can produce general insights and 
also cater to specific audiences, including executives, board members, CISOs, and SOC analysts.

2. Personalization: By integrating user profile information, this function delivers customized analysis. It tailors 
insights and recommendations based on the user's role, industry, or specific requirements, adding a third tier of 
analysis that goes beyond the generalized reports.

All these features are accessed through the FastAPI interface, providing users with a powerful, scalable tool for
accessing and analyzing cybersecurity news feeds. This approach enables a comprehensive view of the threat landscape, 
offering both broad-spectrum analysis and highly personalized insights tailored to individual user needs. By leveraging 
the power of FastAPI and integrating a versatile LLM layer, the service can deliver a dynamic and adaptable platform 
that caters to a wide range of cybersecurity professionals and stakeholders. This ensures users receive relevant, 
actionable information to help them navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.

### other data sources use-cases (AWS re:Invent)

Leveraging the same approach, you can apply the model to analyze events generating large volumes of data, like 
AWS re:Invent. By collecting and storing event content—keynotes, presentations, videos, and transcriptions—you can 
process this information into a structured object model. The raw feeds can be stored alongside analyzed versions, 
providing insights into the content.

An LLM layer can then analyze these materials, offering summaries, key takeaways, and trend analysis. This approach 
can distill hours of content into digestible insights, allowing users to quickly grasp the most important information 
from events like AWS re:Invent.

This method not only provides a valuable resource for those unable to attend such events but also creates a repository 
of analyzed content that can be revisited and referenced. By applying your project's core principles to various 
domains, you can create a versatile platform capable of transforming diverse data sources into valuable, structured insights.
